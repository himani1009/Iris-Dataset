## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** of iris flowers from three species:
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

Each observation includes **4 features**:
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

###  Key Insights
- **Petal features** show clear separation between species.  
- **Setosa** forms a distinct cluster.  
- **Versicolor** and **Virginica** slightly overlap.  
- **Petal Length ↔ Petal Width** correlation ≈ **0.96**  
- **Sepal Width** shows mild outliers.

##  2. Classification Models

| Model              | Accuracy | Kappa | Observation |
|--------------------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Decision Tree      | 93.33%   | 0.90   | Minor overlap between Versicolor & Virginica |
| SVM (Linear)       | 96.67%   | 0.95   | Better separation between species |
| KNN (k=5)          | 100%     | 1.00   | Perfect classification |

##  3. Conclusion
All models performed very well, but **KNN achieved 100% accuracy**, making it the best classifier.  
**Petal-based features** were most discriminative, while **sepal features** added support.
